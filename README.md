Syntax Squad

Syntax Squad is a School of Code team who came together in the final four weeks of their bootcamp to plan, build and deploy a solution to a unique problem posed by their stakeholder, King's Heath Community Basketball Club.

After learning that the current method of scheduling games/training was a low-tech groupchat polling system, a solution had to be found, and the idea for King's Heath Clangers' website was founded. It would be able to improve the booking process for players whilst simultaneously giving easy access to coaches/admin staff to schedule new games.
